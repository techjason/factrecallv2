**Enzymes** are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up chemical
reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process.

## Basic Properties

Enzymes have several key characteristics:

1. **Catalytic Function**

   - Catalyze metabolic reactions (anabolic or catabolic)
   - Lower activation energy
   - Function intracellularly or extracellularly

2. **Specificity**

   - Highly specific due to tertiary structure
   - Each enzyme catalyzes one specific reaction
   - Based on active site shape

3. **Active Site**
   - Specific region where substrate binds
   - Small part of the total enzyme
   - Forms a depression in enzyme surface
   - Shape complementary to substrate

## How Enzymes Work

### Activation Energy

- Activation energy (Ea) is the minimum energy needed for a reaction
- Enzymes lower the activation energy by:
  - Holding substrates in correct orientation
  - Straining bonds in substrate
  - Creating favorable conditions for reaction

### Enzyme-Substrate Complex

When a substrate binds to an enzyme:

1. Forms enzyme-substrate complex
2. Temporary bonds form between enzyme and substrate
3. Lowers activation energy
4. Enables reaction to proceed more easily

## The Induced Fit Model

The modern understanding of enzyme action:

1. **Active Site Flexibility**

   - Active site is flexible
   - Shape changes when substrate approaches
   - Enzyme and substrate modify each other's shape

2. **Process**

   - Substrate approaches enzyme
   - Active site shape adjusts
   - Perfect fit is induced
   - Reaction occurs
   - Products released

3. **Advantages**
   - Explains enzyme specificity
   - Accounts for enzyme regulation
   - Better than older 'lock and key' model

## Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

### 1. Enzyme Concentration

- Higher enzyme concentration = faster reaction
- Linear relationship until substrate becomes limiting

### 2. Substrate Concentration

- Increases rate up to maximum velocity
- Follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics
- Plateaus when enzymes saturated

### 3. Temperature

- Increases rate up to optimum
- Above optimum, enzyme denatures
- Tertiary structure disrupted

### 4. pH

- Each enzyme has optimum pH
- Changes affect enzyme shape
- Can cause denaturation

### 5. Inhibitors

**Competitive Inhibitors**

- Similar shape to substrate
- Compete for active site
- Effects reduced by increasing substrate

**Non-competitive Inhibitors**

- Bind elsewhere on enzyme
- Change active site shape
- Cannot be overcome by substrate

## Enzyme Denaturation

Denaturation occurs when:

- Tertiary structure is disrupted
- Active site shape changes
- Enzyme loses catalytic ability

Causes include:

- Extreme temperature
- Extreme pH
- Some chemicals
- Mutations in primary structure

## Learning Objectives

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How do enzymes lower activation energy?">
    Enzymes lower activation energy by forming an enzyme-substrate complex, holding substrates in the correct orientation, and providing favorable conditions for the reaction to occur.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What is the induced fit model?">
  The induced fit model suggests that an enzyme's active site is flexible and
  changes shape slightly when the substrate approaches, creating a perfect fit.
  This explains enzyme specificity better than the older lock and key model.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do different factors affect enzyme activity?">
    Enzyme activity is affected by temperature, pH, substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, and inhibitors. Each factor can influence the rate of reaction by affecting either the enzyme structure or the frequency of successful collisions.

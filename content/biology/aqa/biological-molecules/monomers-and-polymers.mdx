The variety of life, both past and present, is extensive, but the biochemical
basis of life is similar for all living things.

## Facts

### Monomers and Polymers Definitions

- **Monomers** are the smaller units from which larger molecules are made.
- **Polymers** are molecules made from a large number of monomers joined
  together.

#### Examples of Monomers

- **Monosaccharides** (e.g., glucose, fructose)
- **Amino acids**
- **Nucleotides**

These monomers serve as building blocks for essential biological polymers:

- **Carbohydrates** (e.g., starch, glycogen)
- **Proteins**
- **Nucleic acids** (e.g., DNA, RNA)

### Condensation and Hydrolysis Reactions

#### Condensation Reactions

A **condensation reaction** joins two molecules together with the formation of a
chemical bond and involves the elimination of a molecule of water.

- **Example**: Formation of a dipeptide from two amino acids.

  ```
  Amino Acid + Amino Acid --> Dipeptide + Water
  ```

- **Significance**: This type of reaction is essential in forming complex
  biological polymers from monomers.

#### Hydrolysis Reactions

A **hydrolysis reaction** breaks a chemical bond between two molecules and
involves the use of a water molecule.

- **Example**: Breaking down a disaccharide into two monosaccharides.

  ```
  Disaccharide + Water --> Monosaccharide + Monosaccharide
  ```

- **Significance**: Hydrolysis reactions are crucial for digestion and
  metabolism, allowing organisms to break down complex molecules into usable
  forms.

<Accordion title="What is the biochemical basis of life across different organisms?">
  Despite the vast diversity of life forms that exist, all living organisms
  share similar biochemical foundations. The basic molecular structures and
  chemical processes are common across all life forms.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are monomers and polymers? Can you provide examples?">
    **Monomers** are the smaller units from which larger molecules are made. Examples include:
    - Monosaccharides (glucose, fructose)
    - Amino acids
    - Nucleotides

    **Polymers** are molecules made from a large number of monomers joined together. Examples include:
    - Carbohydrates (starch, glycogen)
    - Proteins
    - Nucleic acids (DNA, RNA)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do condensation reactions form polymers?">
    Condensation reactions join monomers together to form polymers through these steps:
    1. Two molecules are joined together.
    2. A chemical bond is formed between them.
    3. A water molecule is eliminated in the process.

    For example, when two amino acids join to form a dipeptide, a water molecule is released.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do hydrolysis reactions break down polymers?">
    Hydrolysis reactions break polymers into monomers through these steps:
    1. A water molecule is used to break the chemical bond between monomers.
    2. The polymer is split into smaller units.

    This process is crucial for digestion and metabolism, allowing organisms to break down complex molecules into simpler, usable forms.

**Lipids** are a diverse group of organic molecules that are insoluble in water
but soluble in organic solvents. They play crucial roles in energy storage, cell
membrane structure, and various biological processes.

## Facts

### Types of Lipids

There are two main groups of lipids covered in the AQA A-Level specification:

1. **Triglycerides**
2. **Phospholipids**

#### Triglycerides

Triglycerides are formed through condensation reactions between:

- One glycerol molecule (a 3-carbon alcohol)
- Three fatty acid molecules

**Structure and Formation**

- Each fatty acid forms an **ester bond** with glycerol
- General formula for fatty acids: RCOOH
- The 'R' represents a hydrocarbon chain
- Three water molecules are released during formation

#### Fatty Acids

Fatty acids can be classified into two types:

1. **Saturated Fatty Acids**

   - No double bonds between carbon atoms
   - Straight hydrocarbon chains
   - Solid at room temperature
   - Found in animal fats
   - Example: Palmitic acid

2. **Unsaturated Fatty Acids**

   - Contains one or more double bonds
   - Kinked hydrocarbon chains
   - Liquid at room temperature
   - Found in plant oils
   - Example: Oleic acid

### Phospholipids

Phospholipids are modified triglycerides where:

- One fatty acid is replaced by a phosphate group
- Results in a molecule with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions

**Structure and Properties**

1. **Hydrophilic Head**

   - Contains phosphate group
   - Attracted to water
   - Forms outer surface in membranes

2. **Hydrophobic Tails**

   - Two fatty acid chains
   - Repel water
   - Point inward in membranes

### Properties and Functions

#### Triglycerides

1. **Energy Storage**

   - Compact energy store
   - Yields more energy per gram than carbohydrates
   - Insoluble in water
   - Does not affect cell water potential

2. **Insulation**

   - Provides thermal insulation
   - Protects organs
   - Found in adipose tissue

#### Phospholipids

1. **Membrane Formation**

   - Forms bilayers in cell membranes
   - Amphipathic nature allows self-assembly
   - Creates selective barrier

2. **Membrane Properties**

   - Allows selective permeability
   - Fluid mosaic structure
   - Enables membrane protein function

### Biochemical Tests

#### Emulsion Test

1. Add ethanol to the sample
2. Mix thoroughly
3. Add water
4. A white emulsion indicates the presence of lipids

## Recall

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What are the main types of lipids?">
    The two main types are triglycerides and phospholipids. Triglycerides consist of glycerol bonded to three fatty acids, while phospholipids have two fatty acids and one phosphate group.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do saturated and unsaturated fatty acids differ?">
  Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds and form straight chains, while
  unsaturated fatty acids have double bonds and form kinked chains. This affects
  their physical properties and melting points.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are phospholipids important in cell membranes?">
    Their amphipathic nature allows them to form bilayers with hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous environment and hydrophobic tails forming the membrane interior, creating a selective barrier.
  </Accordion>

# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are essential biological molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen. They play crucial roles in energy storage and structural support in
living organisms.

## Monosaccharides

Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates (simple sugars). They are
the monomers from which larger carbohydrates are made.

### Key Features

- General formula: (CH₂O)ₙ
- All contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
- Examples include glucose, fructose, and galactose
- Most monosaccharides are hexose sugars (6 carbon atoms)

### Classification by Carbon Atoms

| Carbon Atoms | Type    | Formula | Example        |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| 3            | Triose  | C₃H₆O₃  | Glyceraldehyde |
| 4            | Tetrose | C₄H₈O₄  | Threose        |
| 5            | Pentose | C₅H₁₀O₅ | Ribose         |
| 6            | Hexose  | C₆H₁₂O₆ | Glucose        |

### Glucose Isomers

Glucose exists in two isomeric forms:

- α-glucose
- β-glucose

These forms differ in the position of the -OH group on carbon-1, leading to
different properties and functions in biological systems.

## Disaccharides

Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides join together through a
condensation reaction, forming a glycosidic bond.

### Common Disaccharides

1. **Maltose**

   - Formed from: glucose + glucose
   - Found in: germinating seeds
   - Type: reducing sugar

2. **Sucrose**

   - Formed from: glucose + fructose
   - Found in: table sugar
   - Type: non-reducing sugar

3. **Lactose**
   - Formed from: glucose + galactose
   - Found in: milk
   - Type: reducing sugar
   - Note: Lactose intolerance occurs when people lack the lactase enzyme to
     break down lactose

## Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides are formed when many monosaccharides join together through
condensation reactions. They serve different functions based on their structure.

### Types of Polysaccharides

1. **Starch**

   - Structure: Made of amylose and amylopectin
   - Components:
     - Amylose: Long, unbranched chains of α-glucose (1,4 bonds)
     - Amylopectin: Branched chains of α-glucose
   - Function: Energy storage in plants
   - Location: Found in leaves and storage organs

2. **Glycogen**

   - Structure: Similar to amylopectin but more branched
   - Function: Energy storage in animals
   - Properties:
     - Compact molecule
     - Readily broken down when energy is needed
     - Stored in liver and muscle cells

3. **Cellulose**
   - Structure: Made of β-glucose units joined by 1,4 glycosidic bonds
   - Function: Structural support in plant cell walls
   - Properties:
     - Forms strong microfibrils through hydrogen bonding
     - Provides strength and rigidity to cell walls

## Properties of Storage Polysaccharides

| Property           | Importance for Energy Storage           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Large molecule     | Cannot diffuse out of cell              |
| Insoluble molecule | Does not affect water potential of cell |
| Compact            | Lots of energy stored in little space   |
| Easily broken down | Readily accessible energy               |

## Biochemical Tests

1. **Benedict's Test**

   - Tests for: Reducing sugars
   - Positive result: Brick-red precipitate
   - Can detect: Glucose, maltose, lactose
   - Cannot detect: Sucrose (non-reducing sugar)

2. **Iodine Test**
   - Tests for: Starch
   - Positive result: Blue-black color
   - Used to identify presence of starch in plant tissues

## Making and Breaking Polymers

- **Condensation**: Joins monomers together, releasing water
- **Hydrolysis**: Breaks polymers apart, using water
- These reactions are important in digestion and energy storage

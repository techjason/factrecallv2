## Facts

### Overview of Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
typically with a hydrogen to oxygen ratio of 2:1. They are a primary source of
energy and play structural roles in organisms.

### Monosaccharides

Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates (simple sugars) and serve
as the monomers for building larger carbohydrates.

#### Key Features

- **General formula**: (CH₂O)ₙ (where _n_ is the number of carbon atoms)
- **Composition**: Contain carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O)
- **Examples**: Glucose, fructose, galactose
- **Classification by Carbon Atoms**:

  | Carbon Atoms | Type    | Formula | Example        |
  | ------------ | ------- | ------- | -------------- |
  | 3            | Triose  | C₃H₆O₃  | Glyceraldehyde |
  | 5            | Pentose | C₅H₁₀O₅ | Ribose         |
  | 6            | Hexose  | C₆H₁₂O₆ | Glucose        |

#### Glucose Isomers

Glucose exists in two isomeric forms:

- **α-glucose**: Hydroxyl (-OH) group on carbon-1 is below the ring
- **β-glucose**: Hydroxyl (-OH) group on carbon-1 is above the ring

This slight difference significantly impacts their biological roles and the
properties of the polymers they form.

### Disaccharides

Disaccharides form when two monosaccharides join via a condensation reaction,
creating a glycosidic bond and releasing a molecule of water.

#### Common Disaccharides

1. **Maltose**

   - **Formation**: Glucose + Glucose
   - **Source**: Germinating seeds
   - **Type**: Reducing sugar

2. **Sucrose**

   - **Formation**: Glucose + Fructose
   - **Source**: Table sugar, transported in phloem of plants
   - **Type**: Non-reducing sugar

3. **Lactose**

   - **Formation**: Glucose + Galactose
   - **Source**: Milk
   - **Type**: Reducing sugar
   - **Note**: Lactose intolerance occurs when individuals lack the enzyme
     lactase to hydrolyze lactose.

### Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides are large, complex carbohydrates formed by the condensation of
many monosaccharides. They serve various functions based on their structure.

#### Types of Polysaccharides

1. **Starch**

   - **Structure**: Made of two polymers of α-glucose:
     - **Amylose**: Unbranched chains with 1,4 glycosidic bonds, forming a
       helical structure
     - **Amylopectin**: Branched chains with 1,4 and 1,6 glycosidic bonds
   - **Function**: Energy storage in plants
   - **Properties**:
     - Insoluble (doesn't affect water potential)
     - Compact (stores energy efficiently)
     - Easily hydrolyzed to release glucose

2. **Glycogen**

   - **Structure**: Similar to amylopectin but more highly branched
   - **Function**: Energy storage in animals
   - **Properties**:
     - Insoluble (doesn't affect osmotic balance)
     - Compact
     - Highly branched (allows rapid glucose release)
     - Stored in liver and muscle cells

3. **Cellulose**

   - **Composition**: Made of β-glucose units joined by 1,4 glycosidic bonds
   - **Structure**:
     - Straight, unbranched chains
     - Chains run parallel and form hydrogen bonds between them
     - Bundled into microfibrils providing high tensile strength
   - **Function**: Provides structural support in plant cell walls
   - **Properties**:
     - High tensile strength
     - Insoluble
     - Rigid structure contributes to cell wall rigidity

### Reducing and Non-Reducing Sugars

#### Reducing Sugars

- **Definition**: Sugars that can donate electrons to another chemical (reducing
  agent)
- **Examples**: All monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose), some
  disaccharides (e.g., maltose, lactose)

#### Non-Reducing Sugars

- **Definition**: Sugars that cannot donate electrons (do not have a free
  aldehyde or ketone group)
- **Example**: Sucrose

### Biochemical Tests

1. **Benedict's Test for Reducing Sugars**

   - **Procedure**:
     - Add Benedict's reagent to the sample
     - Heat the mixture in a boiling water bath
   - **Positive Result**: Color changes from blue to green, yellow, orange, or
     brick-red precipitate (indicates the presence of reducing sugars)
   - **Note**: The color intensity correlates with the amount of reducing sugar

2. **Test for Non-Reducing Sugars**

   - **Procedure**:
     - If the Benedict's test is negative, boil a fresh sample with dilute
       hydrochloric acid to hydrolyze the sugar
     - Neutralize with sodium hydrogen carbonate
     - Perform the Benedict's test again
   - **Positive Result**: Brick-red precipitate after second test indicates the
     presence of non-reducing sugars (e.g., sucrose broken down into glucose and
     fructose)

3. **Iodine Test for Starch**

   - **Procedure**:
     - Add iodine-potassium iodide solution to the sample
   - **Positive Result**: Color changes from brown-orange to blue-black

### Making and Breaking Polymers

- **Condensation Reactions**: Build polymers by joining monomers and releasing
  water
- **Hydrolysis Reactions**: Break down polymers into monomers using water

### Properties of Storage Polysaccharides

| Property               | Importance for Energy Storage                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large molecule**     | Cannot diffuse out of cells                                   |
| **Insoluble**          | Doesn't affect osmotic balance or water potential             |
| **Compact**            | High energy content in a small volume                         |
| **Branched structure** | Multiple ends for rapid enzyme action (quick glucose release) |

### Energy Storage: Glycogen vs. Glucose

- **Glycogen** is more suitable for energy storage in animals compared to
  glucose because:
  - **Insolubility**: Doesn't affect cell's osmotic balance
  - **Compactness**: Stores large amounts of energy in a small space
  - **Branched Structure**: Allows rapid mobilization of glucose when energy is
    needed
  - **Non-diffusible**: Remains within cells

### Structural Comparison: Amylose and Cellulose

- **Amylose**:

  - **Composition**: Unbranched chains of α-glucose
  - **Structure**: Helical due to 1,4 glycosidic bonds
  - **Function**: Energy storage in plants
  - **Properties**:
    - Compact
    - Insoluble

- **Cellulose**:
  - **Composition**: Unbranched chains of β-glucose
  - **Structure**: Straight chains with every other glucose flipped, forming
    strong microfibrils via hydrogen bonds
  - **Function**: Provides structural support in plant cell walls
  - **Properties**:
    - High tensile strength
    - Insoluble
    - Rigid

### Importance of Monosaccharide Structure

- **α-glucose** polymers (e.g., starch and glycogen) are suitable for energy
  storage due to their helical and branched structures
- **β-glucose** polymers (e.g., cellulose) provide structural support due to the
  formation of straight chains and microfibrils

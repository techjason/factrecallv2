**Proteins** are large macromolecules formed from amino acids. They are
essential for life, performing a wide range of functions from structural support
to enzymatic catalysis.

## Amino Acids

Amino acids are the monomers (building blocks) of proteins. All amino acids
share a common basic structure:

- An amine group (-NH₂)
- A carboxyl group (-COOH)
- A variable R group (side chain)
- A central carbon atom

### Key Features

- There are 20 different amino acids used in proteins
- They differ only in their R groups
- The R group determines the properties of each amino acid
- All are α-amino acids (amino group is on carbon next to COOH)

## Peptide Bond Formation

Amino acids join together through condensation reactions:

1. **Dipeptide Formation**

   - Two amino acids join together
   - Forms one peptide bond
   - Releases one water molecule

2. **Polypeptide Formation**
   - Many amino acids join together
   - Multiple peptide bonds form
   - One water molecule released per bond formed

## Protein Structure

Proteins have four levels of structure, each contributing to their final
function:

### 1. Primary Structure

- The sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain
- Determined by genes
- Forms the foundation for higher levels of structure

### 2. Secondary Structure

- Regular folding patterns of the polypeptide chain
- Stabilized by hydrogen bonds
- Two main types:
  - α-helix (spiral structure)
  - β-pleated sheet (zigzag structure)

### 3. Tertiary Structure

- Overall 3D shape of a single polypeptide
- Maintained by various bonds:
  - Hydrogen bonds between R groups
  - Ionic bonds between charged R groups
  - Disulfide bridges between cysteine residues
  - Hydrophobic interactions

### 4. Quaternary Structure

- Assembly of multiple polypeptide chains
- Examples include:
  - Haemoglobin (4 chains)
  - Collagen (3 chains)
  - Insulin (2 chains)

## Protein Functions

Proteins have diverse roles in organisms:

1. **Structural Roles**
   - Collagen in connective tissue
   - Keratin in hair and nails
   - Cross-linked for strength
2. **Metabolic Roles**
   - Enzymes for catalyzing reactions
   - Spherical shape for active sites
3. **Transport Roles**
   - Haemoglobin for oxygen transport
   - Channel proteins in membranes
4. **Immune Response**
   - Antibodies
   - Made of light and heavy chains

## Biochemical Test

### Biuret Test

1. Add biuret reagent (copper sulfate in sodium hydroxide)
2. Positive result: Solution turns purple/mauve
3. Tests for peptide bonds

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What is the basic structure of amino acids?">
    All amino acids have an amine group (-NH₂), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a variable R group attached to a central carbon atom. The R group determines the specific properties of each amino acid.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do the different levels of protein structure relate to function?">
  The primary structure determines the sequence of amino acids, which leads to
  specific secondary structures (α-helix and β-sheets). These fold into a
  tertiary structure, giving the protein its specific shape and function. Some
  proteins combine multiple chains in quaternary structure.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What types of bonds stabilize protein structure?">
    Proteins are stabilized by multiple bonds: hydrogen bonds in secondary structure, ionic bonds between charged R groups, disulfide bridges between cysteines, and hydrophobic interactions in tertiary structure.
  </Accordion>

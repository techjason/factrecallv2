**Nucleic acids** are information-carrying molecules essential for life. DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) stores genetic information, while RNA (ribonucleic acid)
helps transfer this information to make proteins.

## Basic Structure

Both DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of:

- A pentose sugar (5-carbon sugar)
- A phosphate group
- A nitrogen-containing base

### Nucleotide Components

1. **Pentose Sugar**

   - DNA: Deoxyribose
   - RNA: Ribose
   - Difference is in the 2' carbon position

2. **Nitrogen Bases**

   - Purines (double ring):
     - Adenine (A)
     - Guanine (G)
   - Pyrimidines (single ring):
     - Cytosine (C)
     - Thymine (T) - in DNA only
     - Uracil (U) - in RNA only

3. **Phosphate Group**
   - Links nucleotides together
   - Forms phosphodiester bonds
   - Creates sugar-phosphate backbone

## DNA Structure

### Double Helix

- Two polynucleotide strands
- Run antiparallel (opposite directions)
- Held together by hydrogen bonds
- Forms right-handed helix

### Base Pairing

- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T)
  - Two hydrogen bonds
- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C)
  - Three hydrogen bonds
- Mnemonic: "AT GC" (Apple Turns Google Crazy)

### Key Features

- Sugar-phosphate backbone on outside
- Base pairs on inside
- Major and minor grooves
- One complete turn every 10 base pairs
- Base composition: A=T and G=C (Chargaff's rules)

## RNA Structure

### Single Strand

- One polynucleotide chain
- More flexible than DNA
- Usually shorter than DNA
- Can form complex secondary structures

### Key Differences from DNA

1. **Sugar**

   - Contains ribose instead of deoxyribose
   - Extra OH group on 2' carbon

2. **Bases**

   - Uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T)
   - U pairs with A in RNA

3. **Structure**
   - Single-stranded
   - More temporary
   - Various shapes possible

## Historical Context

### Discovery of DNA

- First observed in 1800s
- Structure determined by Watson and Crick
- Used data from many scientists:
  - Franklin's X-ray diffraction
  - Chargaff's base ratios
  - Others' chemical analyses

### Early Doubts

Scientists initially doubted DNA was genetic material because:

- Seemed too simple
- Only four bases
- Regular structure
- Chemical composition

## Learning Objectives

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What are the key differences between DNA and RNA?">
    DNA uses deoxyribose sugar and thymine base, is double-stranded, and stores genetic information. RNA uses ribose sugar and uracil base, is single-stranded, and transfers genetic information.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do bases pair in DNA?">
  Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) using two hydrogen bonds, while Guanine (G)
  pairs with Cytosine (C) using three hydrogen bonds. This specific base pairing
  maintains the double helix structure.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why was DNA initially doubted as genetic material?">
    Scientists thought DNA was too simple to carry genetic information due to its regular structure and limited number of bases. They believed proteins, with their greater complexity, were more likely candidates.

## Key Takeaways

- DNA and RNA are nucleic acids made of nucleotides
- Each nucleotide has three components: sugar, phosphate, and base
- DNA is double-stranded with specific base pairing
- RNA is single-stranded and uses U instead of T
- Both molecules are crucial for genetic information

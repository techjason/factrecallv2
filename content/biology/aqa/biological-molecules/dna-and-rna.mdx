**Nucleic acids** are essential information-carrying molecules of life. DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) stores genetic information, while RNA (ribonucleic acid)
transfers this information for protein synthesis.

## Overview

DNA and RNA are crucial for genetic inheritance and protein synthesis. DNA holds
the genetic blueprint, while RNA translates and helps execute these instructions
to make proteins.

## Basic Structure

Both DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of:

- A pentose sugar (5-carbon sugar)
- A phosphate group
- A nitrogenous base

### Nucleotide Components

1. **Pentose Sugar**

   - **DNA**: Deoxyribose (lacks an oxygen atom at the 2' carbon)
   - **RNA**: Ribose (has an OH group at the 2' carbon)

2. **Nitrogenous Bases**

   - **Purines** (double-ring structure):
     - Adenine (**A**)
     - Guanine (**G**)
   - **Pyrimidines** (single-ring structure):
     - Cytosine (**C**)
     - Thymine (**T**) - in DNA only
     - Uracil (**U**) - in RNA only

3. **Phosphate Group**

   - Links nucleotides via phosphodiester bonds
   - Forms the sugar-phosphate backbone

## DNA Structure

### Double Helix

- Two antiparallel polynucleotide strands
- Held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases
- Right-handed helix structure

### Complementary Base Pairing

- **Adenine** (**A**) pairs with **Thymine** (**T**)
  - Connected by **two** hydrogen bonds
- **Guanine** (**G**) pairs with **Cytosine** (**C**)
  - Connected by **three** hydrogen bonds
- Mnemonic: **"Apples in the Tree, Cars in the Garage"**

### Key Features

- Sugar-phosphate backbone on the outside
- Bases face inward, forming steps of the ladder
- Major and minor grooves facilitate protein interactions
- One complete turn every 10 base pairs (~3.4 nm)
- **Chargaff's rules**: %A = %T and %G = %C

## RNA Structure

### Single-Stranded Molecule

- Generally a single polynucleotide chain
- More flexible and can fold into complex shapes
- Types of RNA:
  - **mRNA** (messenger RNA) - carries genetic code from DNA to ribosomes
  - **tRNA** (transfer RNA) - brings amino acids during protein synthesis
  - **rRNA** (ribosomal RNA) - structural and functional component of ribosomes

### Key Differences from DNA

1. **Sugar**

   - RNA contains ribose sugar with an additional OH group

2. **Bases**

   - **Uracil** (**U**) replaces Thymine (**T**)
   - **U** pairs with **A**

3. **Structure**

   - Single-stranded but can form secondary structures via base pairing within
     the molecule
   - More reactive due to the extra OH group on ribose

## Historical Context

### Discovery of DNA Structure

- **1869**: Friedrich Miescher discovered "nuclein" (DNA) from white blood cells
- **1953**: James Watson and Francis Crick proposed the double-helix model
  - Based on Rosalind Franklin's X-ray diffraction images
  - Chargaff's base composition data
  - Contributions from Maurice Wilkins and others

### Early Doubts About DNA

Scientists initially doubted DNA was the genetic material because:

- **Simplicity**: DNA seemed too simple with only four types of nucleotides
- **Proteins favored**: Proteins, with 20 different amino acids, were thought to
  carry genetic diversity
- **Repetition**: DNA was believed to be a repetitive polymer

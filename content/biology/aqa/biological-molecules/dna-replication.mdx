  Understanding semi-conservative DNA replication in AQA A-Level Biology

**DNA replication** is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during
cell division. This ensures that each daughter cell has an identical copy of the
genetic material.

## Semi-conservative Replication

The term "semi-conservative" means that each new DNA molecule contains:

- One strand from the original DNA molecule
- One newly synthesized strand

### Requirements

For DNA replication to occur, several components are needed:

1. **Nucleotides**

   - All four types (A, G, C, T)
   - Free nucleotides in the nucleus
   - Must be complementary to template

2. **Enzymes**

   - DNA helicase
   - DNA polymerase
   - Other supporting enzymes

3. **Energy**

   - Chemical energy source
   - Drives the process
   - ATP required

4. **Template DNA**
   - Original DNA strands
   - Acts as pattern for new DNA

## The Replication Process

DNA replication occurs in a specific sequence:

### 1. Unwinding

- DNA helicase breaks hydrogen bonds
- Double helix separates
- Creates replication fork

### 2. Template Exposure

- Both strands act as templates
- Bases become exposed
- Ready for complementary pairing

### 3. Nucleotide Addition

- Free nucleotides align
- Match by base pairing rules:
  - A with T
  - G with C
- Forms complementary strands

### 4. Strand Synthesis

- DNA polymerase joins nucleotides
- Forms phosphodiester bonds
- Works in 5' to 3' direction
- Creates sugar-phosphate backbone

### 5. Completion

- Two identical DNA molecules form
- Each contains one old and one new strand
- Hydrogen bonds stabilize structure

## Directional Synthesis

DNA synthesis has important directional constraints:

1. **Antiparallel Strands**

   - DNA strands run in opposite directions
   - One 5' to 3', other 3' to 5'
   - Named by carbon numbers in sugar

2. **DNA Polymerase**

   - Only works 5' to 3' direction
   - Can only add to 3' end
   - Creates directional challenge

3. **Leading Strand**

   - Continuous synthesis
   - Follows replication fork
   - 5' to 3' direction

4. **Lagging Strand**
   - Discontinuous synthesis
   - Made in fragments
   - Later joined together

## Learning Objectives

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why is DNA replication called semi-conservative?">
    In semi-conservative replication, each new DNA molecule contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand, conserving half of the original DNA in each new molecule.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What are the key enzymes in DNA replication?">
  DNA helicase unwinds the double helix and breaks hydrogen bonds, while DNA
  polymerase joins new nucleotides together to form the complementary strands.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is the direction of synthesis important?">
    DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction, which affects how the two new strands must be synthesized, leading to continuous and discontinuous synthesis.
